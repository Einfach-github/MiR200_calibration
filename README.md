# 1. Repository description
`MiR200_calibration`: Codes are aimed to calibrate systematic odometry errors for MiR200. Most codes are inherited from matchRos under following link (https://github.com/matchRos/MiR200_Sim). Note that codes, who are related to kinematic calibration, are changed and added by myself. Other codes stay the same as matchRos. readme_1 is the readme file directly copied from matchRos who shows the original description of packages. The following description focuses only on the codes that i changed or added for calibration.

# 2. Change overview
Some codes are partly modified in terms of the original matchRos codes. Some codes are newly written and added. In this section, i will list those codes, so that you can easily coordinate the codes related to kinematic calibration. For other codes, please visit their original source with the link that i mentioned above.
