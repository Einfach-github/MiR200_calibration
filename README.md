# 1. Repository description
`MiR200_calibration`: Codes are aimed to calibrate systematic odometry errors for MiR200. Most codes are inherited from matchRos under following link (https://github.com/matchRos/MiR200_Sim). Note that codes, who are related to kinematic calibration, are changed and added by myself. Other codes stay the same as matchRos.
